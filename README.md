# Short URL Domains
This list contains a bunch of domains that are used for short urls. Even though it is not complete and may also has some domains listed that are no longer used for short urls it is still quite helpful to detect short urls.

## Add Domain
If you would like to submit a new domain please file an issue ticket. If you want to submit more domains please do so by providing a pull request.

Please do understand that only domains with a valid extension can be added. For a list of valid domain extensions please see https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/tlds-2012-02-25-en

Thank you!

## Remove Domain
If there is a domain that should not be in the list please file an issue ticket. Please do understand that a domain will only be removed if it is no longer registered.
